FEATURES:
    - delays on per-announcement basis
    - manual and automatic announcements
    - group announcements

    - multi language support
    - variables
    - delays should not be affected by lag (as good as possible)
    - announcements and their config should be read from *.txt files
    - announcements should not be posted if there are no players


Messages will be stored in Announcer/messages/(message)/(localcode(en_US)).txt or just Announcer/messages/(message).txt if not translateable.

HOW TO SCHEDULE THE MESSAGES:
1. Player Joins
2. Get all announcments for the player
3. Get lowest common denominator of the delays
4. Translate the delays of the messages to how many times the task should run
5. Schedule a task that run at the lowest common denominator. And uses the new delays for the messages

psedo code of message task:
>>>>
AManager aManager;
User user;
int runs;
int nextExcecution;

void run()
{
    if(this.runs == this.nextExcecution)
    {
        scheduler.queue.append(aManager.getNext(this.user);
        this.nextExcecution = this.runs + aManager.getNextDelay(this.user);
    }
}
